# 4 cool new projects to try in COPR for June 2023

[Copr][copr] is a build-system for anyone in the Fedora community. It
hosts thousands of projects for various purposes and audiences. Some
of them should never be installed by anyone, some are already being
transitioned to the official Fedora Linux repositories, and the rest
is somewhere in between. Copr gives you the opportunity to install 3rd
party software that is not available in Fedora Linux repositories, try
nightly versions of your dependencies, use patched builds of your
favorite tools to support some non-standard use-cases, and just
experiment freely.

If you don't know [how to enable a repository][copr-docs-enable] or if
you are concerned about whether
[is it safe to use Copr][copr-docs-security], please consult the
[project documentation][copr-docs].

This article takes a closer look at interesting projects that recently
landed in Copr.


## chatGPT-shell-cli

This year it seems that anywhere you look, [ChatGPT][chatgpt] is
there. This time we have a lightweight ChatGPT and [DALL-E][dall-e]
client written in Bash called [chatGPT-shell-cli][chatgpt-github].
It can be especially useful for systems without standard
dependencies such as Python or Node.js.

### Installation instructions

The [repo][chatgpt-copr] currently provides `chatgpt-shell-cli` for
Fedora 37, 38, Fedora Rawhide, RHEL8, RHEL9, and others. To install
it, use these commands:

```
sudo dnf copr enable kylegospo/chatGPT-shell-cli
sudo dnf install chatgpt-shell-cli
```


## Hyprland

Hyprland is a beautifully looking compositor for Wayland. It provides
dynamic tiling with multiple layouts, smooth animations, and endless
customization options. Similarly to [Sway][sway] or [i3][i3], it
has a simple configuration file that doesn't require you to know the
programming language it was written in.

sudo dnf copr enable carlwgeorge/hyprland
sudo dnf install hyprland
```


## Wezterm

[Wezterm][wezterm] is a modern terminal emulator that runs on all the
major operating systems. It has built-in support for terminal
multiplexing, rendering images, emojis, GPU acceleration, and many
more features.

### Installation instructions

The [repo][wezterm-copr] currently provides Wezterm for Fedora
37, 38, and Fedora Rawhide. To install it, use these commands:

```
sudo dnf copr enable zjlin/majesty-dubbed-skyline
sudo dnf install wezterm
```


## htpdate

[htpdate][htpdate] is a time synchronization client for the HTTP Time
Protocol (HTP). Is it better than Network Time Protocol (NTP) which is
used in Fedora by default? It's not,
[you should use NTP if you can][htpdate-faq].
However, NTP sometimes doesn't work because of proxy or firewall
restrictions. That's when HTP and `htpdate` become very useful.

37, 38, Fedora Rawhide, Fedora ELN, RHEL8, RHEL9, and others. To
install it, use these commands:

```
sudo dnf copr enable whitehara/htpdate
sudo dnf install htpdate
