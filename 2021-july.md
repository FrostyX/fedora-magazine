# 4 cool new projects to try in COPR for July 2021

COPR is a [collection][copr] of personal repositories for software
that isn’t carried in Fedora. Some software doesn’t conform to
standards that allow easy packaging. Or it may not meet other Fedora
standards, despite being free and open-source. COPR can offer these
projects outside the Fedora set of packages. Software in COPR isn’t
supported by Fedora infrastructure or signed by the project. However,
it can be a neat way to try new or experimental software.

This article presents a few new and interesting projects in COPR. If
you’re new to using COPR, see the [COPR User Documentation][copr-docs]
for how to get started.


## Wike
[Wike][wike] is a Wikipedia reader for the GNOME Desktop with search
integration in the GNOME Shell. It provides distraction-free access to
the [online encyclopedia][wikipedia]. While its interface is
minimalistic, it supports switching an article between multiple
languages, bookmarks, article table of contents, dark mode, and more.

### Installation instructions

The [repo][wike-copr] currently provides Wike for Fedora
33, 34, and Fedora Rawhide. To install it, use these commands:

```
sudo dnf copr enable xfgusta/wike
sudo dnf install wike
```


## DroidCam
We are living through confusing times, being isolated at our homes, and
the majority of our interactions with friends and coworkers takes
place on some video conference platform. Don't waste your money on an
overpriced webcam if you carry one in your pocket already.
[DroidCam][droidcam] lets you pair your phone with a computer and use
it as a dedicated webcam. The connection can be done through a USB
cable or over WiFi. Droidcam provides remote control of the camera and
allows zooming, using autofocus, toggling the LED light, and other
convenient features.

### Installation instructions

The [repo][droidcam-copr] currently provides DroidCam for Fedora 33.
Before installing it, please update your system and reboot, or make sure you are
running the latest kernel version and have an appropriate version of
_kernel-headers_ installed.

```
sudo dnf update
sudo reboot
```

Droidcam depends on _v4l2loopback_ which needs to be installed manually from
[RPM Fusion Free repository][rpm-fusion-free-repository].

```
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
sudo dnf install v4l2loopback
sudo modprobe v4l2loopback
```

Finally, install the _droidcam_ package.

```
sudo dnf copr enable meeuw/droidcam
sudo dnf install droidcam
```


## Nyxt
[Nyxt][nyxt] is a keyboard-oriented, infinitely extensible web browser
designed for power users. It was heavily inspired by Emacs and as as
such it is implemented and configured in Common Lisp, and provides
familiar key-bindings ([Emacs][emacs], [vi][vi], [CUA][cua]).

Killer-features that cannot be missed are a built-in REPL,
[tree history][nyxt-history], [buffers instead of tabs][nyxt-buffers],
and [so much more][nyxt].

Nyxt is web engine agnostic so don't worry about pages rendering
unexpectedly.

### Installation instructions

The [repo][nyxt-copr] currently provides Nyxt for Fedora
33, 34, and Fedora Rawhide. To install it, use these commands:

```
sudo dnf copr enable teervo/nyxt
sudo dnf install nyxt
```


## Bottom
[Bottom][bottom] is a system monitor with a customizable interface and
multitude of features, It took inspiration from [gtop][gtop], [gotop][gotop],
and [htop][htop]. As such, it supports [processes][bottom-processes]
monitoring, [CPU][bottom-cpu], [RAM][bottom-ram],
and [network][bottom-network] usage monitoring. Besides those, it
provides also more exotic widgets such as [disk capacity][bottom-disk]
usage, [temperature sensors][bottom-temp], and
[battery][bottom-battery] usage.

It utilizes the screen estate very efficiently thanks to the
customizable layout of widgets as well as the
[possibility to focus on just one widget and maximizing it][expansion].
